Hi everyone! I recently created a tool to help engineers and students analyze multi-span beams using the Slope-Deflection Method. It generates bending moment diagrams, shear force diagrams, and more in a simple, intuitive interface.

Big thanks to my UI designer [Ajayi Tomiwa](https://linktr.ee/tommy_studi0s) for making the interface so user-friendly! 🎨

I’d love for you to try it out and share your feedback. Let me know what you think or how it could be improved!
