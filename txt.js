🌟 Excited to Share My New Beam Analysis Tool! 🌟

As a software engineering and structural engineering enthusiast, I’m thrilled to announce the launch of a tool I’ve been working on to simplify beam analysis using the Slope-Deflection Method! 🚀

📐 Why I Built It:
I wanted to create a user-friendly platform that bridges the gap between manual calculations and expensive analysis software, making engineering accessible to everyone.
